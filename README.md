# IsosurfaceCpp

A C++ library consisting of different isosurface extracting algorithms.
Its only dependency is the mathematics library [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/).

An example of how to use IsosurfaceCpp as a submodule can be found on https://github.com/chrismile/LineVis.
The library can also be compiled and installed as a standalone package using CMake.
